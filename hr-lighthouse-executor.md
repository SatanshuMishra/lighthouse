## Goal

Run 4 of the harness-redesign program (~/.mitosis/harness-redesign/PROGRAM.md, logbook thread harness-redesign in the pipeline repository): make lighthouse compute its verdict from K3 check results only, execute an interphase record's K1 lines as its paths, bound every wait by measured durations, measure contrast without pixel guesses, probe the profile at init, and open the FEATURE pull request on an unproven verdict in the same run. Full lane, overrides O1 to O10 applied by hand.

## Done when

- [ ] c1 L1 The verdict is computed from K3 check results only: a passed path whose evidence file is missing, a new path that failed once without a retry, a check that passed 2 of 3 trials, and a suite result that differs from suite.json each make the verdict not green.
- [ ] c2 L2 With a record holding K1 lines, lighthouse executes those lines as its paths, each path id equal to its check id, plus neighbours computed by code from the changed files.
- [ ] c3 L3 The child session, the suite and the run each have a time limit taken from durations measured at init.
- [ ] c4 L4 Contrast is measured from declared colours or the accessibility tree where available; a pixel sample within 0.3 of a threshold is could-not-run, never a failure.
- [ ] c5 L5 lighthouse init runs the suite, the start command, the readiness check and each driver once and records their durations; available is read by code.
- [ ] c6 L6 An unproven verdict opens the FEATURE pull request in the same run, listing what could not be reached; no second run exists only to add --final.

## Where things stand

The FEATURE branch feat/hr-lighthouse-executor holds the CI fix (lighthouse#21) and the locked tests at b9eabdc: 60 tests written by three fresh check authors, each failing at f4da7f7 through accept.zsh, with the existing suite passing and nothing written under the real HOME. Two prose checks were loosened to their rows before the lock at the parent session's request (reach as code or a quoted key, the draft sentence in either word order). The receipt-lock line is in receipts-lock.txt. The first mitosis build runs in the background (7 Lanes, MSP executor, plan bff94b06179a).

## Next step

When the build reports, read mitosis's last JSON line, write each lane's Assumption notes to review/executor.assumptions.txt, run the 60 locked checks at the MSP head (O4), then start review round 1.

Needs: D1.

## Decisions in force

- D1 interphase hand-off: build the spec as one MSP of 7 Steps with 60 locked K1 lines: Hand off now: one MSP executor with 7 Steps, 60 K1 lines and 27 assumptions; the next step is the O2 check author on feat/hr-lighthouse-executor.

## Open risks

- R1 Locked acceptance test files sit in their Steps' write-sets because interphase's items format requires it; only worker rules, the receipts lock hash and the locked checks at each MSP head keep a Worker from loosening them. Bears on c1.
- R2 A repository whose tests pin its root entries fails once .lighthouse/profile.json is first committed on FEATURE; lighthouse reports that as a suite failure rather than hiding it. Bears on c5.

## Settled, do not reopen

## Where the details live

- Program: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/harness-redesign/PROGRAM.md (run 4 of 7; intent I1 to I6, contracts K1 to K7, overrides O1 to O10)
- Audit: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/harness-redesign/audit/lighthouse.md
- Contracts: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/harness-redesign/contracts/ (k1-acceptance, k2-locked, k3-check-result, k6-outcome)
- Spec, decisions, record, items: /Users/satanshumishra/Documents/DevLabs/lighthouse/docs/specs/hr-lighthouse-executor.*
- Run home: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/lighthouse/hr-lighthouse-executor/ (acceptance.jsonl holds the 60 K1 lines; check-author-brief.md the check authors' brief; CHARTER.md the Workers' charter and locked list; items.json, run.zsh, dispatch.zsh, worker-rules.txt)
