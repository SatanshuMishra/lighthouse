## Goal

Run 4 of the harness-redesign program (~/.mitosis/harness-redesign/PROGRAM.md, logbook thread harness-redesign in the pipeline repository): make lighthouse compute its verdict from K3 check results only, execute an interphase record's K1 lines as its paths, bound every wait by measured durations, measure contrast without pixel guesses, probe the profile at init, and open the FEATURE pull request on an unproven verdict in the same run. Full lane, overrides O1 to O10 applied by hand.

## Done when

- [ ] c1 L1 The verdict is computed from K3 check results only: a passed path whose evidence file is missing, a new path that failed once without a retry, a check that passed 2 of 3 trials, and a suite result that differs from suite.json each make the verdict not green.
- [ ] c2 L2 With a record holding K1 lines, lighthouse executes those lines as its paths, each path id equal to its check id, plus neighbours computed by code from the changed files.
- [ ] c3 L3 The child session, the suite and the run each have a time limit taken from durations measured at init.
- [ ] c4 L4 Contrast is measured from declared colours or the accessibility tree where available; a pixel sample within 0.3 of a threshold is could-not-run, never a failure.
- [ ] c5 L5 lighthouse init runs the suite, the start command, the readiness check and each driver once and records their durations; available is read by code.
- [ ] c6 L6 An unproven verdict opens the FEATURE pull request in the same run, listing what could not be reached; no second run exists only to add --final.

## Where things stand

Checkout synced at db3e5bb; readiness reports nothing open; receipts.config.json is already committed, so receipts setup is skipped. Stage 1 (interphase) is next.

## Next step

Invoke interphase:feature with the request citing I1 to I6, L1 to L6, the contract schemas and the O10 line, ending Work autonomously.

## Decisions in force

## Open risks

## Settled, do not reopen

## Where the details live

- Program: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/harness-redesign/PROGRAM.md (run 4 of 7; intent I1 to I6, contracts K1 to K7, overrides O1 to O10)
- Audit: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/harness-redesign/audit/lighthouse.md
- Contracts: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/harness-redesign/contracts/ (k1-acceptance, k2-locked, k3-check-result, k6-outcome)
- Run home: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/lighthouse/hr-lighthouse-executor/
- Worked example: /Users/satanshumishra/.mitosis/VMLab/hr-vmlab-capabilities/
