## Goal

Run 4 of the harness-redesign program (~/.mitosis/harness-redesign/PROGRAM.md, logbook thread harness-redesign in the pipeline repository): make lighthouse compute its verdict from K3 check results only, execute an interphase record's K1 lines as its paths, bound every wait by measured durations, measure contrast without pixel guesses, probe the profile at init, and open the FEATURE pull request on an unproven verdict in the same run. Full lane, overrides O1 to O10 applied by hand.

## Done when

- [ ] c1 L1 The verdict is computed from K3 check results only: a passed path whose evidence file is missing, a new path that failed once without a retry, a check that passed 2 of 3 trials, and a suite result that differs from suite.json each make the verdict not green.
- [ ] c2 L2 With a record holding K1 lines, lighthouse executes those lines as its paths, each path id equal to its check id, plus neighbours computed by code from the changed files.
- [ ] c3 L3 The child session, the suite and the run each have a time limit taken from durations measured at init.
- [ ] c4 L4 Contrast is measured from declared colours or the accessibility tree where available; a pixel sample within 0.3 of a threshold is could-not-run, never a failure.
- [ ] c5 L5 lighthouse init runs the suite, the start command, the readiness check and each driver once and records their durations; available is read by code.
- [ ] c6 L6 An unproven verdict opens the FEATURE pull request in the same run, listing what could not be reached; no second run exists only to add --final.

## Where things stand

The FEATURE branch feat/hr-lighthouse-executor holds the CI fix (lighthouse#21) and the 60 locked tests at b9eabdc, each failing at f4da7f7 through accept.zsh; the receipt-lock line is in receipts-lock.txt. The MSP executor is on mitosis/executor at 078fff4 (worktree ~/.mitosis/runs/lighthouse/hr-lighthouse-executor/trees/executor). Round 3's blocker S1 (inherited signal mask) and advisory C1 are fixed there: process_tree holds forwarded signals in Python with held() and never touches the kernel mask, the receipt was red at 960d4b3 and passes, the selecting checks are empty, the locked files are untouched, and there is no stash and no trailer. At 078fff4 all 60 locked checks pass (O4) and the full suite passes under Python 3.15 (419 tests, 3 skipped); under Python 3.9 it fails only the two tests.test_suite tests that fail from 312f746 on (a step's background process is still running), which round 4 records as suite finding U1. Both outputs are round 4's suite file. In review round 4 the code-reviewer and security-reviewer judge the fix diff from 960d4b3. review/report-notes.txt holds what goes only to the final report.

## Next step

When the locked checks and both suites at 078fff4 finish, keep both outputs as round 4's suite file, dispatch the code-reviewer and security-reviewer, then collect their findings with U1, and run candidates, the validator, record and verdict.

Needs: D1.

## Decisions in force

- D1 interphase hand-off: build the spec as one MSP of 7 Steps with 60 locked K1 lines: Hand off now: one MSP executor with 7 Steps, 60 K1 lines and 27 assumptions; the next step is the O2 check author on feat/hr-lighthouse-executor.

## Open risks

- R1 Locked acceptance test files sit in their Steps' write-sets because interphase's items format requires it; only worker rules, the receipts lock hash and the locked checks at each MSP head keep a Worker from loosening them. Bears on c1.
- R2 A repository whose tests pin its root entries fails once .lighthouse/profile.json is first committed on FEATURE; lighthouse reports that as a suite failure rather than hiding it. Bears on c5.
- R3 The suite runs so far used Python 3.15, which hides failures the CI's Python 3.9 shows; every head's suite now runs under both, and a 3.9-only failure is a suite finding. Bears on c3.

## Settled, do not reopen
